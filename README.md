## The Model:
The first part of developing a BI report/ dashboard is data modelling. The relationship between data files has to be established. The model created for this project is seen below:

## The Dashboard:
The dashboard shows some key insights that might be useful for the upper level management. They provided a sample dataset of 4000 customers across five cities on their online spending and other details. It can be deduced that there are 2 times more male than female in the dataset and most of the subjects are salaried IT employees.

One of the key insights that the management would like to know is the average income utilization percentage. The result was gotten from dividing the total amount of money spent by the total income of the cusomers. It can be observed that customers spend approximately 2.3 times more than they make.
