#### My solution for: https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge
A dashboard built with Power BI to report insights, analysis, and key findings to the strategy team of Mitron Bank. This analysis is expected to guide them in tailoring the credit cards to customer needs and market trends. 

Mitron Bank is a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad. They want to introduce a new line of credit cards, aiming to broaden its product offerings and reach in the financial market.

## The Model:
The first part of developing a BI report/ dashboard is data modelling. The relationship between data files has to be established. The model created for this project is seen below:

## The Dashboard:
The dashboard shows some key insights that might be useful for the upper level management. They provided a sample dataset of 4000 customers across five cities on their online spending and other details. It can be deduced that there are 2 times more male than female in the dataset and most of the customers are salaried IT employees. It cannot be ascertained if this is a reflection of the bank's customer population or a coincedence in the sample.

### Key Insights
- One of the key insights that the management would like to know is the average income utilization percentage. The result was gotten from dividing the total amount of money spent by the total income of the cusomers. It can be observed that customers spend approximately 2.57 times more than they make.
- The top 10 spenders are married customers living in Mumbai. The bank might want to create programs for that category especially bearing in mind that Mumbai is the financial capital of India and one of the most-populated cities.
- Mumbai has the highest number of customer transactions from the sample data with a total of 232,848 occurences. Second is Chennai with 180,144, then Bengaluru 162,216 and 128,088 in New Delhi NCR.
- The 45+ age group make the most money and have the lowest income utilization while on the other end of the spectrum, the 21-24 age group make the least income and have the second lowest income utilization.
- As seen below, the highest amount of money was spent on bills, and the more money was spend in September than other months in the data sample.

- There seems to be an approximately equal distribution of spending across the 4 modes of payment namely; Credit Card, Debit card, Net Banking, and UPI.

More insights such as how much is spent via each payment type, amount spent on various categories, and amount spent in different months can be drilled down on the dashboard.
